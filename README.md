# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

Notebooks and material from the IBM Course. Most of the excercies and examples were carried out directly on the IBM Db2 database. 

I only upload here what I have in the form of a Notebook, carried out with python or with SQL magic

[Query Db2 with Python](DB0201EN-Week3-1-2-Querying-v4-py.ipynb)

[SQL magic](DB0201EN-Week3-1-3-SQLmagic-v3-py.ipynb)
